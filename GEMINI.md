# MTS & The Power of Google's AI

### Core Technology

The Matrix Trading System (MTS) is built on **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. The ADK provides the foundational framework that enables robust communication, orchestration, and tool-use capabilities among the specialized agents. It allows `Agent Smith` to manage the workflow and ensures that each agent can effectively use the `Trading` and `Risk` tools.

### Agent Intelligence

Each agent's "brain" is powered by the **Gemini family of models**. The complex behaviors and decision-making processes of agents like `Oracle` (market analysis) or `Morpheus` (risk management) are not hardcoded. Instead, they are emergent properties that arise from the natural language instruction prompts given to them.

This approach allows for incredible flexibility. An agent's strategy can be modified by simply changing its prompt, rather than rewriting complex code.

### Why Google AI?

Google's AI stack was chosen for this project for several key reasons:

*   **Robust Framework:** The ADK provides a scalable and well-designed architecture for building sophisticated multi-agent systems.
*   **Powerful Reasoning:** The Gemini models offer state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities, allowing the agents to interpret complex market data and make nuanced decisions.
*   **Ease of Integration:** The seamless integration between the ADK and Gemini models simplifies the development process and allows for rapid prototyping of new agent behaviors.
